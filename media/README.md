# Data Folders
My setup uses the same folder structure from TechHutTV. 
```
data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downloads
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qbittorrent
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ incomplete
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ torrents
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nzbget

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ movies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ music
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shows

```

Create the directory:
```
mkdir -p downloads/qbittorrent/{completed,incomplete,torrents} && mkdir -p downloads/nzbget/{completed,intermediate,nzb,queue,tmp}
```

# Gluetun VPN
### Testing Gluetun Connectivity
Once your containers are up, you can test your connection to your provider.
```
docker run --rm --network=container:gluetun alpine:3.18 sh -c "apk add wget && wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io"
```

### Passing Through Containers
When containers are in the same docker compose, all you need to add is a network_mode: `service:container_name` and open the ports through the the gluetun container. See example from the arr-compose.yaml
```
services:
  gluetun: # This config is for wireguard tested with Mullvad
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    container_name: gluetun
    ...
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "6881:6881"
      - "6881:6881/udp"
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    container_name: qbittorrent
    ...
    network_mode: service:gluetun
```
### External Container to Gluetun
Add `--network=container:gluetun` when launching a container from outside the stack.

### Container in another docker compose
Add `network_mode: "container:gluetun"` to your docker-compose.yaml. Ensure you open the ports through the gluetun container.

### Arr apps wont connect to prowlarr
This setup will run Prowlarr though a VPN as it is the service that will fetch magnet links and skim torrent sites. If you have issues with connections between arr apps and prowlarr you need to allow gluetun to access your lan. You can do this by adding the following to your docker compose file under the glutun enviromental varibles.

`- FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS=192.168.1.0/24 #change to your specific subnet`

### Gluetun Proxmox Fix
"cannot Unix Open TUN device file: operation not permitted and cannot create TUN device file node: operation not permitted" May happen if you're running this on LXC containers.

Find your container number, mine is 110

edit `/etc/pve/lxc/110.conf` and add:
```
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net dev/net none bind,create=dir
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file
```
Make sure you pass through the tun device (/dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun) as shown in arr-compose.yaml.

### Reduce Gluetun Ram Usage
Gluetun bundles a recursive caching DNS resolver called unbound for handling domain name requests securely. Over time the cache size, which rests in RAM, can balloon to gigabytes.

You can reduce this by adding the following to your docker compose file under the glutun enviromental varibles.

`BLOCK_MALICIOUS=off`
This may not be an issue as DNS over HTTPS in Go to replace Unbound is implemented.

### Testing Other Containers
Jump into the Exec console and run the wget command below. Tested with qbittorrent and prowlarr. Ensure you open the ports through the the gluetun container.
```
docker exec -it conatiner_name bash
wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io
```

# Flood UI
**Flood** is a modern, sleek, and responsive web interface designed for interacting with your torrent client. Whether you're using **qBittorrent**, **Transmission**, **Deluge**, or **rTorrent**, Flood provides a highly visual, intuitive way to manage your downloads.

It‚Äôs an excellent alternative to the default web UIs, offering enhanced usability, mobile-friendly design, and real-time updates‚Äîall in a polished, minimalist interface.

> ‚úÖ Personally tested and preferred with **qBittorrent**, but supports multiple backends.

### Features

- Full torrent control: add, pause, resume, and delete torrents
- Real-time download stats and graphs
- File prioritization and detailed torrent breakdowns
- Responsive UI ‚Äì works great on mobile, tablet and desktop
- Multi-user support with role-based access

### Interface Preview

# Download Clients

### NZBGet
**Fix directory does not appear to exist inside the container error**
This error may appear within Sonarr and Radarr. Once NZBGet is setup go to settings and under INCOMING NZBS change the AppendCategoryDir to No. This will prevent some potential mapping issues and save on unnessesary directories.

### qBittorrent
**qBittorrent Stalls with VPN Timeout**
I noticed that qBittorrent stalls out if there is a timeout or any type of interuption on the VPN. This is good because it drops connection, but I need it to start back up when the connection is restored without manually restarting the container.

**Solution #1:** Within the WebUI of qbittorrent head over to advanced options and select `tun0` as the networking interface. See image below.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6ea317-db4a-4af2-a46a-52e1d43296f0)

**Solution #2:** Deunhealth container - automatically restart qbittorrent and prowlarr when they give an unheathly status.
Add the deunhealth service to your stack. This is already included in arr-compose.yaml
```
  deunhealth:
    image: qmcgaw/deunhealth
    container_name: deunhealth
    network_mode: "none"
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
      - HEALTH_SERVER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:9999
      - TZ=America/Halifax
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```
Next add a healthcheck and label to the container(s). Add `deunhealth.restart.on.unhealthy=true` as a label and a simple ping health check as shown below.
```
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    container_name: qbittorrent
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      deunhealth.restart.on.unhealthy=true # Label for deunhealth
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Halifax
      - WEBUI_PORT=8080
      - TORRENTING_PORT=6881
    volumes:
      - /docker/qbittorrent:/config
      - /data:/data
    network_mode: service:gluetun
    healthcheck:
        test: ping -c 1 www.google.com || exit 1
        interval: 60s
        retries: 3
        start_period: 20s
        timeout: 10s
```

# Arr apps
The **ARR Stack** is a powerful collection of self-hosted applications designed to automate and organize your entire media library‚Äîfrom movies and TV shows to music and subtitles. This stack simplifies the process of searching, downloading, renaming, organizing, and even subtitle syncing‚Äîall while seamlessly integrating with your preferred torrent or Usenet clients.

## Included Applications

| App       | Role                                         | Description |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Radarr** | üé• Movie Management                         | Automates the discovery, downloading, and organization of movies. Supports custom quality profiles, scheduled searches, and renaming logic. |
| **Sonarr** | üì∫ TV Show Management                       | Tracks your favorite series, monitors for new episodes, downloads automatically, and organizes them with your preferred naming scheme. |
| **Lidarr** | üéµ Music Management                         | Designed for managing music collections. Lidarr can monitor artists, albums, and tracks‚Äîautomating downloads and organizing your music library. |
| **Bazarr** | üìù Subtitle Management                      | Fetches and syncs subtitles for your TV shows and movies using the metadata from Radarr and Sonarr. Supports multiple languages and providers. |
| **Prowlarr** | üîç Indexer Aggregator & Manager         | Acts as a central indexer manager for all other *ARR* apps. Supports over 500 indexers and integrates directly with Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, and others for seamless search and filtering. |

## How It Works

1. **Prowlarr** manages your indexers and passes metadata to Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr.
2. **Radarr**, **Sonarr**, and **Lidarr** monitor for media content you want‚Äîwhether it's movies, shows, or music.
3. They communicate with your download clients (like qBittorrent, NZBGet, or SABnzbd) to fetch the files.
4. Once downloaded, the apps automatically rename and move them to the correct folders.
5. **Bazarr** then detects the new media and fetches the best available subtitles for them.
6. The result: a fully organized, ready-to-watch/listen media library‚Äîhands-free.

## Features

- Automated downloading with custom quality and language profiles
- Intelligent media organization and renaming
- Subtitles fetched and synced automatically
- Supports both Torrent and Usenet
- API support and full integration between components
- Easily extensible with third-party apps and downloaders

# tdarr Automated Media Transcoding
**Tdarr** is a powerful, distributed media transcoding system that automatically optimizes your video library by converting files into more space-efficient formats‚Äîmost commonly **H.265 (HEVC)**. It‚Äôs perfect for large libraries where reducing file sizes can lead to massive storage savings without significant loss in visual quality.

### What It Does

- Automatically scans your media folders for inefficient or non-compliant files
- Uses customizable filters and plugins to decide which files should be transcoded
- Transcodes videos into smaller formats (like **H.265**) using tools like `ffmpeg`, `HandBrake`, or `nvenc` (for GPU-accelerated encoding)
- Replaces the original files or stores them in a new directory once conversion is complete
- Supports distributed processing via multiple worker nodes for faster performance

### Why Use Tdarr?

- **Save Disk Space:** H.265 can reduce file sizes by up to 50% compared to H.264 with similar quality
- **Fully Automated:** Set it up once and let it process new or existing files in the background
- **Works With Arrs:** Tdarr replaces entire files with new codec and Arr apps will see the change
