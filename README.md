# How I Got Into Homelabbing
I didn’t set out to become a “homelabber” it kind of just happened.

At first I was just curious. I seen posts online of people building these amazing self-hosted setups, dashboards, media servers, entire networks running from a single machine tucked in a closet - I was hooked. Not because I needed any of it, really, but because I wanted to understand how it all worked.

I started small. Following YouTube videos with linux, turned to learning docker then deployed a couple of Docker containers… nothing too serious. But that first successful deployment - watching something I built with my own hands actually work, it hit different. It wasn’t just about the tech. It was about full control, learning, and having the freedom to test, break, and rebuild without pressure. That’s what kept me hooked.

Homelabbing for me, became this perfect mix of problem solving and creativity. It’s fun. It’s frustrating. It’s incredibly satisfying. I can spin up apps to try out new ideas, test software in a way that feels safe, and constantly challenge myself to get better at managing systems. It doesn’t matter if it’s a self-hosted VPN, a personal cloud, or just a private media server - every new service is a little win, a reminder that learning doesn’t have to be rigid or formal.

And honestly, it’s just cool seeing what other people are building. There’s a sense of community in the homelab world - people showing off their setups, sharing configs, helping each other out. That kind of energy is rare, and it makes the experience even better. I started becoming more active on subreddits like [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) and [r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) - I seen very small groups of people or single devs building amazing looking apps. I love the creativity.

This repo is a bit of a snapshot of that journey. Some things here are experiments, some are long-term tools I actually use, and some are just here because I wanted to try something new. Either way, it’s all part of the process. I’m not trying to build the most impressive setup out there - I’m just building my setup, learning as I go.

If you’re here just browsing, or thinking about starting your own lab, I hope you find something useful - or at least relatable.
